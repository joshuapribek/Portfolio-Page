            Hello, my name is Joshua Pribek. I was born and raised in Northern Virginia to a loving home. I did well in
            school, but I never felt like I belonged. No where I went or who I was surrounded by, I never fit in. This
            lead me down a dark road in high school. My life got turned upside down, and it turned for the
            worst. I went down a long road of certain things I shouldn't have gotten into at the time. This long journey
            of bad decisions and questionable ideas has brought me to Southern California, right here in 2020. I made a
            decsion to turn my life around. My life is so full today. I have genuine freindships today, people that
            actually know the real me and care about my wellbeing. I decided to do a bootcamp and I'm progressing in
            life and doing a whole career change, and it's seemingly working out. I have a beautiful girlfriend, some of
            our pictures are shown on the portfolio section of this page. I'm blessed and very excited to see what the
            future has in store for me.
        </p>
